Our Futures
===========

Our Futures is a game that encourages you to imagine new ways to involve people in thinking about the future. It can be played by anyone but is particularly relevant for futures professionals, artists, designers and technologists, as well as anyone with responsibility for engaging or consulting the public. Players (individuals or teams) compete to devise scenarios for new types of participatory futures activities that combine emerging technologies and a focus on tackling 21st century challenges, such as biodiversity loss or extreme weather events.

We've open sourced the design files so you can translate or adapt the game. Instructions on how to do this using GitHub are below.

You can read more about the game and its development [on the Nesta website](https://www.nesta.org.uk/feature/our-futures/).
